In 1996 Microsoft's "Core fonts for the web" project provided high-quality,
no-cost TrueType fonts for use on the web. For the benefit of searchers, these
are often referred to as corefonts, ms-corefonts, and mscorefonts. Use
`cabextract` to install on Linux. See the Wikipedia page for much more
information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web

This repo exists because SourceForge's ad-stuffing on the download pages of the
[long-surviving mirror](http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/) 
[inconvenienced me](https://push.cx/2015/installing-you-need-a-budget-ynab-on-arch-linux).
